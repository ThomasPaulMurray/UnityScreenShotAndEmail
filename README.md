# UnityScreenShotAndEmail
This is a simple script for Unity, which takes a snapshot of the current screen which can then be emailed to a remote server. Written for an augmented reality app, where a photo
was taken in app, with characters imposed upon them, a couple of other projects that I have worked on required the same functionality and as such I thought other unity devs might 
benefit from it.
